1. Configure the Pull (Upstream) Branch
    --The pull branch determines where Git fetches updates from.
    >> git branch --set-upstream-to=<remote>/<branch>
    --Replace <remote> (e.g., origin) with your remote repository's name and <branch> with the branch

you want to pull from.
    >> git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/main


2. Configure the Push Branch
    -- By default, Git pushes to the same branch you are on, but you can set a different branch for pushing.

    To set the push branch explicitly:
    >> git config branch.<current-branch>.pushRemote <remote>
    >> git config remote.<remote>.push +refs/heads/<branch>:refs/heads/<branch>

    Example for pushing to a branch feature-push:
    >> git config branch.main.pushRemote origin
    >> git config remote.origin.push +refs/heads/feature-push:refs/heads/feature-push



== Verify the Configuration
    *To ensure the pull and push branches are set correctly, run:
    >> git branch -vv      ----This will display all local branches, their tracking (upstream) branches, and their statuses.


==set pull and push branch diffrent
 Pull from --origin/main.
 Push to --origin/development.
Then Run:
    >> git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/main
    >> git config branch.main.pushRemote origin
    >> git config remote.origin.push +refs/heads/development:refs/heads/development
